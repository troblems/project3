<p>I have comprehensive computer networking knowledge from a series of CCNA prep courses. Further tech skills include multiplayer game backend and bug procedures from my time as a Game Master for a major gaming company, website and forum backend and management from several years as a volunteer site administrator, and web development and API integration experience from a failed startup. Non-tech skills include conflict resolution, contractor management, and some voice acting experience.</p>

<p>I have traveled to places as far flung as Australia, including several trips to Europe, and, while rusty, have conversational use of Russian as well as essential use of Spanish. I am highly self-motivated which has been critical to my rehabilitation and acquisition of tech skills following medical problems that forced me to drop out of UC San Bernardino. I enjoy gaming, reading, and working out, and have a wicked sense of humor.</p>
